Before you'll start answering questions: Combine columns from tables: raw_data, tax_selector and consumption_data based on a related column between them. Filter out taxes with 'No' in 'Include?' column from main table (this should be applied to all data related questions and dashboard). Create column 'Region' with region information for each state and make population column readable.

1.Determine state which has the highest amount of taxes per person. 
2.Determine state with the third largest amount of collected taxes. 
3.Name region with the smallest value of sum of "Individual Income Taxes" and "Income Taxes". 
4.Calculate percent changes of personal consumption expenditures between 2018 and 2020 for each state and determine state and year with highest change (example: Florida 2018/2019) 
5.Determine Region with the highest average Personal Consumption Expenditures per person in 2020
